#include "BackchannelESPNOW.h"


/*!
Setup the backchannel for the SBR using the ESPNOW protocol.

Specifically:
 
The BackchannelESPNOW class is derived from the BackchannelSBR class
which handles packing and unpacking the packets.

The BackchannelESPNOW object owns a BackchannelTransceiverESPNOW object
which implements the ESPNOW protocol using the ESPNOW_Transceiver.

The BackchannelESPNOW and BackchannelTransceiverESPNOW classes are implemented in
the StabilizedVehicle library.a64l

The ESPNOW_Transceiver class is implemented in the Receiver library.
