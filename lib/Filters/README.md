# Filters Library

This library contains a collection of filter classes. They have been developed for use in a Self Balancing Robot and have been used to:

1. Filter gyro and accelerometer output for use in the Attitude and Heading Reference System (AHRS).
2. Filter motor encoder values for use in the motor controller.
3. Filter derivative terms in a PID controller.
4. Filter motor power input values to smooth the motor speed.
